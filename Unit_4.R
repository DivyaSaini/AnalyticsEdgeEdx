# Unit 4 - "Judge, Jury, and Classifier" Lecture


# Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
# A yes response is always to the left and a no response is always to the right.
# There are different ways to control how many splits are generated.
# One way is by setting a lower bound for the number of data points in each subset.
# In R, this is called the minbucket parameter, for the minimum number of observations in each bucket or subset.
# The smaller minbucket is, the more splits will be generated.
# But if it's too small, overfitting will occur.
# This means that CART will fit the training set almost perfectly.
# But this is bad because then the model will probably not perform well on test set data or new data.
# On the other hand, if the minbucket parameter is too large, the model will be too simple and the accuracy will be poor.
